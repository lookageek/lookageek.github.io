There is this explosion of value (*read: money*) in the technology space - especially in software tech that every tom dick and harry is jumping the ship from whichever field they are in, to establish their companies and ideas - that they want tech to come by and solve for them, no matter if there is any demand for a such technology based solutions and products.

No, I am not saying that we need to banish the influx from these diverse sectors (*read: non-tech*) and just embark ourselves onto pristine tech based ambitions and goals a la *self driving cars* - this inbound diversity is in turn leading to the diversity in the set of problems technology is getting solve, which is fantastic for the growth of industry irrespective of whether the solutions or products see the light of the day or not.

But there is a very low signal-to-noise ratio on these problems that are getting solved using technology - leading to a situation where seemingly bizarre problems are shoehorning tech into them and begging for solutions - almost beating technology into submission to their whims. *But why?.* I believe that these problems and ideas are outliers and we are not there yet as a market to solve these with technology and adopt it - and there can be far more efficient solutions without using technology at all, one has to just look rather than run behind buzzwords(_read: predominantly IoT_)!

Just to ride the bandwagon of technology and cash in has lead to a good amount of precious time being wasted in this community doing pointless work!

Thus I propose a *__brotherhood of gatekeepers__* for technology industry who will vet ideas and problems whether they can be solved using current state-of-the-art efficiently or in an envisioned future, plus points for ideas which can have a significant impact to the market when end product is brought forth. We as torch-bearers of technology should not be working on things which are not supposed to be solved by technology!
